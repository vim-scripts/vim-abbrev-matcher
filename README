Unlike "traditional" fuzzy search it matches by beginnings of words. For example, "fb" matches "foo_bar" but not "if_bar". Words considered are groups of alphabetic characters, groups of digits and "CamelCase" words. All other symbols, including underscore (_) and dash (-) are word separators.

This allows faster narrowing of search results to a needed candidate, with less typing.
